<a href="https://carrot.ac.uk/">Carrot Mapper</a> is a webapp which allows the user to use the metadata (as output by [WhiteRabbit](https://github.com/OHDSI/WhiteRabbit)) from a dataset to produce mapping rules to the OMOP standard, in the JSON format. These can be ingested by [Carrot Transform](https://carrot.ac.uk/transform/quickstart) to perform the mapping of the contents of the dataset to OMOP.

Carrot Transform transforms input data into tab separated variable files of standard OMOP tables, with  concepts mapped according to the provided rules (generated from Carrot Mapper).
